See document Viruses CBIABM R1 Supplementary Material S1_V3 for instructions on how to run the CBIABM

This model was developed in Netlogo 6.1.1, and requires a download of the Netlogo package in order to run (free download available from https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml ).

See the Info Tab in the executable file for information about the model and how to run the simulation experiments present in the publication.

The Behavior Space function under the "Tools" dropdown menu provides the parameters and conditions for the simulation experiments. Note that the variables can be set from the buttons, switches and sliders in the Interface, but that in order to replicated the simulation experiments in the paper the needed variables should be explicitly set in Behavior Space
